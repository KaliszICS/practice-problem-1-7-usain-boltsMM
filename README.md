# Instructions  

# Practice Problem 1.7

1. Create two Booleans called _bool1_ which is assigned to true, and _bool2_ that is assigned to false.  Output the result of them being ANDed together, then output the result of them being ORed together.  Output these results on different lines.</br>
</br>
2. Ask the user to "Input a lowercase letter: " and store it in a variable.  Ask the user to "Input another lowercase letter: " and store it in another variable.  Output true if the first letter happens earlier in the alphabet, False otherwise.</br>
</br>
3. Ask the user to "Input a number: ".  Output true when the value is between 0 and 10 (inclusive).  Output false otherwise.</br>
</br>
4. Ask the user to "Input a number: ".  Output true when the number is positive and is not 5.  Output false otherwise.</br>
</br>
5. Ask the user to "Input a word: ".  Ouput true when the word is not "banana".  Output false otherwise.</br>
</br>
6. Ask the user, “Enter an integer: ” Input the user’s response from the keyboard, test the integer to see if it is even or odd (use the modulus operator % to do this), and then output the result as shown below (several runs are shown):


Enter an integer: 28

The integer 28 is true.

Enter an integer: 2049

The integer 2049 is false.

Enter an integer: -236

The integer -236 is true.
